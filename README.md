# shine-forth-bot
Shine Forth Bot is a chatbot created for a class in Spring 2017. Essentially its purpose was for me to learn how to use api.ai and other natural language processing APIs. This was created before Lex, else I would have gone all Amazon.

## Technologies used
* api.ai
* JavaScript (jQuery)
* AWS Lambda

## How to run
You'd have to connect it to an api.ai instance, obviously the key and other bits used in my original project won't work since you can't login and train the bot.
